    <h1>My Favorite Restaurants</h1>
   <p class="bean">Whenever I travel, I love to check out the local cuisine and the most popular restaurants! <strong>SAVANNAH, GA </strong>has some of the best eateries and beautiful architecture. Their long standing historic properties nearth Forsyth Park are nicely preserved and even rented out as AirBNBs for tourists. It is the perfect location to venture out to some beautiful sites and get a taste of all the cuisine that Savannah has to offer. </p>
